# Plate Picker

## Overview
Plate Picker is a session-based web application designed to simplify the meal selection process for groups. Inspired by the swipe mechanism of Tinder, Plate Picker allows users to swipe through a collection of default meals or their custom-added meals. A match is found when all participating users like the same meal, facilitating a consensus on what to have or make together.

This repository contains the .NET C# Web API for Plate Picker, responsible for handling backend logic, data management, and API endpoints for the application.
